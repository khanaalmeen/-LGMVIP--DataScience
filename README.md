## Image to Pencil Sketch With Python
(Level - Beginner)

● We need to read the image in RGB format and convert it into grayscale image.

● This will turn the image into classic black and white photo.

● Then the next thing to do is to convert grayscale image also known an inverted image, this is our inverted grayscale image. Inversion is used to enhance the details.

● Finally we will create a pencil sketch by mixing the grayscale image with the inverted blurry image. This can be done by dividing the grayscale image by inverted blurry image.
